        CURRENT MOTORCYCLE TYPES
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Standard:
        Also referred to as "naked bikes" or "roadsters", are versatile and general purpose street motorcycles. They provide upright riding positions. Due to their flexibility, lower costs, and moderate engine output, they are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners.

        Cruiser:
        Cruisers are styled after the American motorcycles of the 1930s to the early 1960s, commonly made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. The motorcycles often have large-displacement V-twin engines which are tuned for low-end torque. This makes them less demanding to ride because it is not necessary to shift as frequently while accelerating or mainting speed. The frame of the bike forces the riding position of the feet upward and the handlebars are relatively high. The chopper style of bike is a cruiser.

        Spork Bike:
        Spork bikes emphasize top end speed, acceleration, braking, and handling over all else. This is usually accompanied by poor fuel economy and poor comfort for the rider. The capabilities of sport bikes are possible by the high performance engines that reside inside their relatively light frame. Inline-four engines are predominant in these bikes. Sport bikes have high footpegs that position the legs closer to the body to improve ground clearance when cornering. There is also a long reach towards the controls of the bike as the rider leans forward.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Touring:
        Touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances. They have large-displacement engines, fairings and screens that offer good weather and wind protection. They also have a relaxed upright seating position.
