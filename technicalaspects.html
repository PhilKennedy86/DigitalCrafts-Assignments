        TECHNICAL ASPECTS
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Motorcycle construction is the engineering, manufacturing, and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle which results in the performance, cost, and aesthetics desired by the designer. With some exceptions, construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame, telescopic forks holding the front wheel, and disc brakes. Some other body parts, designed for either aesthetic or performance reasons may be added. A petrol powered engine typically consisting of between one and four cylinders coupled to a manual five or six-speed sequential transmission drives the swingarm-mounted rear wheel by a chain, driveshaft, or belt. Repair can be done using a Motorcycle lift.
