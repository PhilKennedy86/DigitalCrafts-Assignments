It was built by the German invetors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstaff, Germany in 1885. The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was the three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884. The vehicle was built by Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich, in 1888.
